Image compression is a crucial technique that reduces the storage space required for images without compromising their visual quality. In this project, we have implemented an image compression technique using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) in MATLAB GUI. Our approach involves dividing the image into blocks, performing DCT on each block, quantizing the coefficients, and compressing the resulting data using lossless compression techniques. The compressed image is then reconstructed by performing the inverse DCT on each block. Our MATLAB GUI allows users to select an image and view the original and compressed images along with their sizes.
